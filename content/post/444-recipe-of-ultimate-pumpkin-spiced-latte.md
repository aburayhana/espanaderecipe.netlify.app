It is similar to the Starbucks® Pumpkin Spice Latte, but I personally like this better. Top with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice. This is exactly how I fix my morning coffee (minus the pumpkin pie spice) using stevia to equal the sugar amount so I knew I would like the basic recipe. The pumpkin pie spice does give this coffee a little flavor but the downside is that the spices all collect in the bottom of the cup making it impossible to drink down to the last drop.
